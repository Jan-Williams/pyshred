This repository contains the code for the paper "Sensing with shallow recurrent decoder networks" by Jan P. Williams, Olivia Zahn, and J. Nathan Kutz. SHallow REcurrent Decoders (SHRED) are models that learn a mapping from trajectories of sensor measurements to a high-dimensional, spatio-temporal state. For an example use of SHRED, see the iPython notebook example.ipynb.
